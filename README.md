# Twenty Seventeen Child ( WordPress theme )

## A **WordPress in the Classroom** theme

>This theme is one of the themes I made for my book [WordPress in the Classroom](http://ipaper.ipapercms.dk/ErhvervsakademiAarhus/Forskningsrapportguides/wordpress-in-the-classroom/). The themes are not made for production. They are made for the classroom, that is for students, developers and teachers learning the [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org) craft and code.
